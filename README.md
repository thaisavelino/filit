# filit

This projects is to search for the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities. In this particular project, the idea is to create an algorithm which fits some Tetriminos together into the smallest possible square, in the minimal amount of time, amount of time, despite a exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
